The first dataset is a list of all Danish politicians, both former and current. The dataset contains information about which party they belong to and if they are in the current Danish parliament or EU parliament. This dataset was scraped from the website danskepolitikere.dk. The politicianâ€™s names where used to guess the gender which was added as an attribute to the dataset. The second dataset consist of the Wikipedia texts for all the Danish politicians who have a Wikipedia page and are in the first dataset. The information from the Wikipedia page was used to extract the age and the links to other politicians Wikipedia page. These links represent edges in the network.",
